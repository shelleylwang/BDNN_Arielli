The bed is devoid of fossils and thins gradually toward the eastern corner of the\r\nquarry;\r\nUnit 3: Overyling with sharp contact, this unit is a 6.4 cm thick, light gray, limy pebble conglomerate that is lithologically similar to the basal Unit 1. As in Unit 1, the conglomerate contains sparse xenacanth teeth\r\nand occasional isolated (disarticulated) tetrapod bones;\r\nUnit 4: The upper portion of the conglomerate in Unit 3 bears a sharp contact with a thin bed of reddish gray mudstone, the bonebed layer, which hosts the densest concentration of fossils, including partial\r\nskeletons. The unit is approximately 6.4 cm thick and, in addition to the vertebrate remains detailed below, contains sparse shells of microconchid invertebrates (up to ~3 mm diameter). Its uppermost contact\r\npreserves a paleosurface with extensive mudcracks. Sparse xenacanth teeth show little abrasion, suggesting limited transport or reworking, and are interspersed among semi-articulated and disarticulated tetrapod skeletons. Skeletal remains are densest in the northeastern portion of the quarry, with multiple stacked, disarticulated skeletons that include the large temnospondyl amphibian Eryops and the synapsids\r\nOphiacodon and Edaphosaurus, among other scattered tetrapod bones. A predominantly NW-SE trend of the bones is roughly tangential to the main trunk channel, indicating gentle but directional flow and arguing against the possibility that it is either a pond or crevasse splay deposit.\r\nUnit 5: Overlying the mudrock is a somewhat friable 5.7 cm thick fine-grained sandstone with a pebble lag. Portions of the sandstone may weather into plates or wedges that reveal plant compressions, primarily\r\nrusty woody debris with no discernable morphology;\r\nUnit 6: The sandstone of Unit 5 is overlain by more than 30 cm thickness of dull orange, massive, siltstoneâprobably redeposited loessite (Soreghan et al., 2002a, 2002b)âwith centimeter-scale lenses of light gray, fine-grained sandstone. The massive, silty bed also contains occasional fragments of bone.",mudstone,"desiccation cracks,gray,red",lithified,,fluvial indet.,,"macrofossils,mesofossils",,,,,,,taxonomic,"selective quarrying,surface (float),surface (in situ),field collection,survey of museum collection",,"1990, 1991, 2015","The bonebed area was cleaned offâcollecting and recording weathered bones and teeth found âin floatâ on the bonebed quarry surface at the beginning of each excavationâand quarried using hand tools over an approximate area of 3.4 m wide along strike and 3.5 m into the quarry face (11.9 m2). Taphonomic observations were recorded both during excavations (including environmentally informative sedimentary and ichnological features) and after excavation of the jackets (condition of bones and their orientations and positions relative to each other). Field jackets were marked with exposed side as âtopâ and a north arrow on that side in order to maintain orientations of individual bones or bone clusters in the laboratory. This allowed bone orientations to be recorded to determine whether current flow acted on the bone deposit. Orientation measurements were taken from individual long bones in all blocks, although articulated âstringsâ of bones (e.g., vertebrae) were measured together in some cases. Bones with irregular shape were ignored.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

In this work the occurence of <i>T. raridentatus</i> in the Pechora River drainage basin is confirmed, but the type specimen designated and figured therein is said to come from the Mezen' River drainage basin which is west of the Timan Ridge (not east as is the Pechora River drainage basin). The information on the type and referred material of <i>T. raridentatus</i> as given by Novikov (1991) is repeated (and thus confirmed, somehow) by Ivakhnenko (2008). Hence, the entry ""n. gen. Timanophon n. sp. raridentatus"" (falsely indicating the type occurence) was corrected to ""Timanophon raridentatus"". (TL, 2015-04-22)",phosphatic,,,,,,
