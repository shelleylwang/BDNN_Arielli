The channel sandstone is a fining-upward sequence with no evidence of epsilon-cross beds (i.e., point bars). This would presumably indicate a braided river environment. However, along with the very large amount of fine-grained sediment present, the absence ofcomplex mid- channel bars (tabular sets or several large cross bed sequences perpendicular to small cross bed sequences), suggests that the sandstone represents an isolated channel fill sequence incised into a wet, swampy, muddy area. ll resembles a distributary channel, but it is not related to a large lake.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton.

In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The basin was enclosed by carbonate platforms. The fine-grained sediments and missing evidence of reworking, the mostly complete preserved vertebrate skeletons which are not oriented indicate that there was at most a weak current at the bottom of the basin and that the sediments were deposited below wave base. The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S. The common remains of highly marine animals, primarily pelagic fish, ichthyosaurs, ammonoids, and daonellids prove that the surface waters had normnal salinity and was at least periodically connected to the waters of the Triassic Paleotethys.""

The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S.

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying âupper siltstoneâ member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common. The conglomerates alternate with finer layers of green to pale grey mudstone and siltstone that often include root traces and other organics, but do not show any large-scale evidence of oxidation.""",conglomerate,"gypsiferous,intraclastic,brown,yellow",,sandy,Y,siltstone,"gray,green",,,,,"""repeated transient flooding events concentrated vertebrate (bones, carcasses, live animals) and plant material from the landscape surface, possibly in hyperconcentrated flows. These events were separated by periods of standing water and weakly-developed, poorly-drained (hydromorphic) soil formation. The hydromorphic nature of the paleosols is evidenced by the drab matrix colorations, abundance of yellow-brown (goethite) mottles, preservation of organic matter, including local leaf litter, predominance of goethite rhizocretions, and general dearth of other redoximorphic features. The high density of channel deposits incised into overbank sediments in the Petrified Forest Member indicate that avulsions were common on the Late Triassic landscape of the Chama Basin, and therefore that the Petrified Forest Member fluvial systems were unstable in this area. This large-scale instability in the local base level and resulting incision has also been reported for the Petrified Forest Member in northern Arizona""",macrofossils,,,,,NA,,,,concentrate,concentrated,,,,

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The basin was enclosed by carbonate platforms. The fine-grained sediments and missing evidence of reworking, the mostly complete preserved vertebrate skeletons which are not oriented indicate that there was at most a weak current at the bottom of the basin and that the sediments were deposited below wave base. The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S. The common remains of highly marine animals, primarily pelagic fish, ichthyosaurs, ammonoids, and daonellids prove that the surface waters had normnal salinity and was at least periodically connected to the waters of the Triassic Paleotethys.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying âupper siltstoneâ member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones.

The latter is listed as referred specimen of S. permianum in Lund (1978 p. 66). Anderson (2002, J. Paleont. 76(6) p. 1031) lists both UCMP 62480 and 62580 as type of S. permianum. Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980. OMNH 71111 and OMNH 71112, although not explicitly mentioned by Bolt (1980), well may belong to the material that was originally assigned to ""species x"". Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The basin was enclosed by carbonate platforms. The fine-grained sediments and missing evidence of reworking, the mostly complete preserved vertebrate skeletons which are not oriented indicate that there was at most a weak current at the bottom of the basin and that the sediments were deposited below wave base. The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S. The common remains of highly marine animals, primarily pelagic fish, ichthyosaurs, ammonoids, and daonellids prove that the surface waters had normnal salinity and was at least periodically connected to the waters of the Triassic Paleotethys.""

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

In 2002, we acquired samples of a tuffaceous sandstone at the base of the Blue Mesa Member locally and had the detrital zircons analysed by U-Pb geochronology, but were unable to report results until Heckert et al. (2009). Other workers have also obtained age estimates for this horizon, including Irmis and Mundil (2008) and Irmis et al. (2011) Despite using three different techniques, each at different laboratories, all have estimated an age of approximately 220 Ma (Table 1). As a detrital zircon estimate, this is by definition a maximum age, and the dated horizon is approximately 43 m above the Doswellia occurrence, so it is possible that the site is as much as several million years older than 220 Ma. However, given the rarity of Late Triassic age constraints associated with biostratigraphically useful tetrapods, c. 220 Ma is a reasonable approximation for the numerical age of the D. sixmilensis type locality, although it is several million years younger than the age estimates of homotaxial strata recently published by Ramezani et al. (2011)."" \r\n\r\nAlthough Heckert et al (2012) argue that an age of 220 Ma places this locality in the Carnian, most recent work and recent geological timescales use an age of approximately 228 Ma for the Carnian/Norian boundary (e.g. International Committee on Stratigraphy, 2012) and so the locality is entered here as Norian.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz.

At the excavation site P.902 near Mirigioli at Monte San Giorgio, the total tickness of the GBZ, comprising the beds 3 to 186 at this location, was measured to be 15.8 m. The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

Based on the mapped offset of the position of the Lockatong Formation pinch-out on the east and the boundary between the Stockton and Hammer Creek formations on the west side of the dike, the stratigraphic position of Sphodrosaurus pennsylvanicus should be between the upper Lockatong Formation and the Graters Member of the Passaic Formation, most likely somewhere close to member D or E-F (Fig. 1).

Broom (1909 in Rogers & Du Toit, An Introduction to the Geology of Cape Colony, 2nd ed., p. 192/193) states that mesosaur remains have been found in the ""White Band"" of Herbert, the latter being a region in the Pixley ka Seme District Municipality of the Northern Cape Province which approximately matches the position of the former Albania District.  Also, Oelofsen & Araujo (1987, S. Afr. J. Sci. 83) say, that the occurrence of mesosaurs in South Africa is exclusively restricted to the Whitehill Formation (""the White Band"") of the Ecca Group. Thus, the present collection is assigned to the Whitehill Fm.\r\nRadiometric ages of the Collinson Fm. (overlying the Whitehill Fm.) vary between 270 and 275 Ma (Turner, 1999, J. Afr.

Immediately below the specimen, the sediment shows conspicuous bioturbation. The sediment encasing the pterosaur is a dark grey limestone. The sedimentary unit (12 cm thick) including the fossil can be divided into three main parts (Fig. 4): 1) Basal most part (3 cm thick): a micritic limestone with less fossil shells than seen elsewhere; the base is erosional with scour-and-fill-structures; 2) Middle part (5 cm): the matrix is micritic and contains many ooids, and shells (mostly convex side up) and shell fragments; lamellibranchs with both shells preserved are rare; the ooids often have fragments of bivalves and gastropods as nuclei; towards the upper part the\r\nooids show a decrease in grain size, indicating a small scale fining upward sequence; 3) Upper part (4 cm): this micritic part is the matrix of the pterosaur, it shows marly laminated intercalations; the ooid content decreases gradually, they are missing in the uppermost part; the last part of the slab is built up by laminated, yellow, calcareous marl; the latter yields thin shell\r\nfragments and rare ganoid scales. The layer above the specimen is of a 1 cm thick grey clay followed by a 28 cm thick finely laminated grey limestone. ",lime mudstone,"bioturbation,gray",lithified,calcareous,Y,marl,"shelly/skeletal,yellow",lithified,calcareous,,,"""The presence of ooids indicates shallow turbulent water in a subtidal environment (Furrer 1993). The ooids from the middle part come from such an environment but were transported and redeposited by a storm. The normal graded bedding, the convex up/down position of the shells and the frequent telescoping\r\nposition support this. The layer including the pterosaur is interpreted as a storm deposit, a tempestite that was subsequently bioturbated (presence of Thalassinoides). The increased marl content, the complete absence of ooids in the uppermost part and the clay layer indicate laminar, non-turbulent lower energy conditions. The thin layer of grey clay can be interpreted as a fine deposition during a quiet sedimentation period. The finely laminated, yellow, limestone is interpreted as cyanobacterial mats developed in the intertidal zone.""",macrofossils,,,,,NA,,allochthonous,snapshot,,#NAME?,,,,

[...] The beds of the more or less laminated dolomites make up about 80% of the total thickness of the GBZ. Depending on the degree of weathering and on the content of organic matter (up to 12 weight %), the dolomite beds are dark grey, dark brown to light beige. In freshly-mined condition, in the galleries of the former mines, they are almost black (high organic matter content) or dark to medium grey. The the original carbonate mud is completely dolomitized. There is no evidence of other carbonate phases. The laminae of the mostly parallel and continuous fine lamination vary in thickness from 0.1 to 5 mm. In most cases the lamination is caused by a rhythmic change of the content of dolomite, clay minerals, and organic matter. However, in dolomite-rich laminae also graded bedding may be observed occasionally. [...] The black shales contain no or at most few carbonate. The content of organic matter ranges from 10 up to 40 weight %. The fine lamination of freshly-mined shale is well visible only in thin sections. Partly weathered, the black shale delaminates into thin (mostly less than 1 mm) laminae [...]. The lamination is caused by a change of organic matter, clay minerals, and quartz. The quartz is mainly biogenic. Radiolarians are very common and partly form small laminae of silica in the black shales."" (translated from H.-P. Rieber, 2000, in D. Meischner (ed.)

The water depth of the basin is estimated to have been 30 to 100 m with a gradual deepening through time. The undisturbed lamination of the GBZ rocks and a lack of autochthonous benthos point out that the basin in which the GBZ generated had a stable stratification of the water column and that the bottom water was almost always anoxic and rich in H2S.

Since UCMP 62480 is a braincase according to Lund (1978) and UCMP 62580 is a braincase as well (McGinnis, 1967; Lund, 1978) and since there is only one aistopod braincase present in the Fort Sill material (Anderson, 2002) the type of S. permianum is very likely to be UCMP 62580.\r\nAnderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly say when the type of Bolterpeton carrolli was collected but it is improbable that this specimen was known to Bolt in 1980.

Furthermore, Anderson & Reisz (2003) do not explicitly assign the remainder of ""species x"" to Bolterpeton. Nevertheless they say that these specimens are ""closely related"" to Bolterpeton, but ""because of the size difference between Bolterpeton and Species X, it cannot be said whether Species X is a different species or an ontogenetic variant.""

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying âupper siltstoneâ member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones.

In this work the occurence of <i>T. raridentatus</i> in the Pechora River drainage basin is confirmed, but the type specimen designated and figured therein is said to come from the Mezen' River drainage basin which is west of the Timan Ridge (not east as is the Pechora River drainage basin). The information on the type and referred material of <i>T. raridentatus</i> as given by Novikov (1991) is repeated (and thus confirmed, somehow) by Ivakhnenko (2008). Hence, the entry ""n. gen.
