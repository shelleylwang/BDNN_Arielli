# Permian-Triassic Diversity Rates Analyses

This project applies feed-forward neural networks to take time-series, discrete, and continuous fossil occurrence data, input it into a deep-learning model, and output extinction rates, speciation rates, sampling rates, times of rate shifts, etc. 

The ultimate result is that researchers may trace out the evolutionary trajectory of species with high validity. Input data comes from multiple sources and can include nearly anything -- geographic, morphology, genomics, human presence, paleotemperature, etc. 

The BDNN model is developed by Torsten Hauffe and Daniele Silvestro [here](https://github.com/dsilvestro/PyRate/blob/master/pyrate_lib/bdnn_lib.py)
